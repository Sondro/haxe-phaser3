 * A Render Texture.
 *
 * A Render Texture is a special texture that allows any number of Game Objects to be drawn to it. You can take many complex objects and
 * draw them all to this one texture, which can they be used as the texture for other Game Object's. It's a way to generate dynamic
 * textures at run-time that are WebGL friendly and don't invoke expensive GPU uploads.
